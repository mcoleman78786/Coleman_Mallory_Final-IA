It’s an ideal space with all the amenities required for us to accomplish all the “behind the scenes” work of the TRAA. Many thanks go out to the continued support of Melchers Construction Ltd.</p>

Even with larger fixtures installed a few years ago, it was still frustrating on days when the mercury dipped below -15C and the fluorescent technology just teased us with its dull flicker. Enter Mike Jeffries of Guillevin Greentech in London with nice set of bright and dependable (and new!) LED fixtures. Once they were installed it was like working in well-appointed laboratory.</p>
